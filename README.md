# PyBer Analysis - Ride-Sharing Data by City Type 
## Purpose 
Analysing PyBer ride-sharing data in rural, sub-urban, and urban areas to provide valuable insights on the company's relative performance in these different city types. 
## Results 
### Summary Data 
There were some predictable results when analyzing data for total rides, drivers, fares, and their averages across different city types. The results are as follows (reference the summary dataframe pictured in the image below):

- Total Rides 
  - total rides were greatest in urban cities (1,625), second largest in suburban (625), and smallest in rural areas (125). 
  - urban cities had a substantially larger number of rides vs other city categorizations:
    - over double that of urban cities
    - thirteen times more than that of rural cities. 
  - suburban cities saw five times the number of rides vs. rural areas  

- Total Drivers 
  -  Similar relationship as drivers: largest in urban areas (2,405), second largest in suburban (490), and smallest in rural cities (78). 
  -  An even greater disparity in these quantities vs total rides:
      -  Urban cities had almost five times the number of drivers vs suburban cities 
      - Urban cities had thirty times more drivers than rural city areas.   
      - Suburban cities had six times the number of drivers vs. rural city areas. 

- Total Fares: 
  - Largest number of total fares coming from urban city areas ($39, 854), second largest from suburban ($19,356), and smallest total fare amount from rural areas ($4,328). 
  - Total fares were almost exactly double in Urban areas vs. Suburban areas 
  - Total fares were approxiamtely nine times greater in urban areas vs. rural areas 
  - Total fares were four times greater in suburban cities vs rural city areas.
  
- Average Fare/Ride 
  - The average fare per ride represented an inverse relationship in comparison with the above pieces of data: 
    - highest average fare/ride seen in rural cities ($34.62)
    - Second highest in suburban areas ($30.97)
    - Lowest average fare in urban city types ($24.53)
  - Disparity amongst these values were tighter, ranging anywhere around 10-50% greater in respective city types. 

- Average Fare/Driver
  - Similar relationship as average fare/ride:greatest average far in rural areas ($55.49), second greatest in suburban areas ($39.50), and lowest average fare per driver in urban cities ($16.57)
  - Disparity amongst these values were more accentuated with rural cities having more than 3 times greater average fare/driver vs. urban areas.
  - suburban average fare/driver was two times larger than that of urban cities. 

### Weekly Fare($) Data (January - April 2019)
Similar deductions can be made when analyzing weekly fare data occuring between the months of January-April 2019. Some new inferences are also available with this analysis (see image below):

- total fares for urban city types was substantially larger across all months, followed by suburban, and lastly, lowest in rural city areas. 
- total fares across all city types followed generally a similar pattern through the months of January - April. 
  -   a slight spike in total fares toward the end of February/beginning of March. 
  -   a very gradual increase through January to April- although this trend is apparently quite minor.
